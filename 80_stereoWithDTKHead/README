See example in ../71_moveTeapotWithDTKShm/ before this.

Note when the objects are far away, past the view frustum base surface,
and you change from H P R (heading, pitch, roll) from (0,0,0) to (20,0,0)
increasing heading that your left eye is moving back from the screen
making the relative size of the objects appear to fill more of the view,
and so appear larger, but remember your frustum angle of view is
decreasing at the same time your distance to the object is increasing
which is not what happens in real life.  In real life your angle of
view, or view frustum, or visual acuity, stays the same.  You must draw
some triangles to understand this.

ProjectionViewModifier surface points have to be counterclockwise,
starting with the lower left corner.
