Q: What is this?

A: Me trying to figure out InstantReality (http://instantreality.org),
Given that most of the examples that come from that site just produce a
plain black window.  If an example does not cause you to see something
it's not a good example.  These examples don't do much, they are "hello
World" like.  If they show a plain black window or just crash please let
me know.

My interest is to make an interface for InstantReality to drive our CAVE
(Cube or whatever) here at Virginia Tech, room 3090 Torgersen Hall.
InstantReality will not be the only way to use our CAVE.

It does not appear that all X3D files are usable with InstantReality, for
example the stuff at http://x3dgraphics.com that works with the current
firefox (--version = 43.0 on Ubuntu, in particular xubuntu).


The program `xmllint' can be used to check the xml based .x3d files.  For
example run:

  xmllint 11_multiWindow/multiWindow.x3d


To get started run in this directory:

   ./demo


To remove generated files run:

   make clean

To build all the code without running the demo run:

   make build
