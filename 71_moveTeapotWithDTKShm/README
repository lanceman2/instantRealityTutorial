This example InstantIO plugin reads DIVERSE position (x,y,z) and orientation
(H,P,R or heading,pitch,roll in degrees) from shared memory, which is like
head tracker data (at the Virginia Tech CAVE), and then converts it
to InstantReality position (x,y,z) and orientation (quaternions).
The two coordinate systems share the same origin but DIVERSE z is up
and InstantReality y is up ... or

DIVERSE x = InstantReality x
DIVERSE z = InstantReality y
DIVERSE y = InstantReality -z

Run './demo.bash' and you'll see the DIVERSE origin marked by an axes set
with (blue) z pointing up, and another axes the represents the position
and orientation of the teapot in a more natural teapot InstantReality
space.

Move the sliders, view it, and understand...
